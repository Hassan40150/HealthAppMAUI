# Nomie – Health Tracking App

Nomie is a cross-platform health tracking application designed to help users manage weight loss, weight gain, or weight maintenance through simple daily check-ins, clear progress tracking, and consistent habit-building features.

## Why I Made This

Many existing health and food tracking apps focus almost exclusively on weight loss and often require separate mobile and web implementations. I wanted to build a single, maintainable system that:

- Supports **multiple health goals** (loss, gain, maintenance)
- Works **across web and mobile** using one core codebase
- Focuses on **consistency and habit formation**, not just numbers
- Prioritises **data integrity, security, and scalability**

This project was developed as a Final Year Project and as a practical exploration of modern .NET cross-platform development using MAUI and a modular backend architecture.

## How It Works

1. **User Registration & Authentication**  
   Users register and log in securely using cookie-based authentication and claims identity.

2. **Onboarding**  
   Users define their weight goals, calorie targets, and hydration targets. These values are used for dynamic calculations throughout the app.

3. **Daily Check-Ins**  
   Users submit daily entries for:
   - Calories
   - Water intake
   - Weight

4. **Dynamic Validation**  
   The backend ensures:
   - Only one valid check-in per day
   - Existing check-ins are updated, not duplicated
   - All data is validated before persistence

5. **Streak Tracking**  
   Streaks are automatically calculated and dynamically corrected based on whether daily goals are actually met.

6. **Dashboard & Journal**  
   Users view progress summaries, streak status, and can submit daily journal entries for reflection.

7. **Cross-Platform Delivery**  
   The web application is embedded inside a .NET MAUI app using WebView, allowing it to function as both a web app and a mobile app from a single codebase.
